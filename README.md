Aspect-based sentiment analysis using multiple LSTM architectures with attention and POS features
# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (LSTM)

## Overview
Aspect-based sentiment classification (positive/neutral/negative) using an LSTM model with aspect information.

## What this does
- Preprocesses text (tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization)
- Trains an LSTM-based sentiment classifier
- Reports accuracy / F1 on a validation or test set

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run:
   python absa_lstm.py

## Notes
dataset not included.
